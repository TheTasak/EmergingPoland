# Emerging Poland
Project that has a goal of providing useful information from financial statements of companies in a more readable and thought-provoking way. It is currently incomplete because of lack of funds to buy a full-fledged database containing all of the necesary information. The end goal was to have all of the stocks available on WSE and possibly in Eastern Europe.
But in its up-to-date form it has data about 60 WSE stocks, a simple API that can be used to set reminders about new statement and update data from the database and numerous advanced charts that allow to get a different view on company's data and its trends.
